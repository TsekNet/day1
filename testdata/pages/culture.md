# 🌟 Culture & Communication

How we work together:

- 📝 **Default to async** — Write it down. Docs and chat over meetings.
- 🎯 **Be direct** — Respectful candor is valued. Say what you mean.
- 🚀 **Own your work** — Take initiative. Ask forgiveness, not permission.
- 🤝 **Help others** — Share what you learn. Mentor when you can.
- ⚖️ **Balance matters** — Sustainable pace beats heroic sprints.
