# 🛡️ Security & Compliance

Five rules that keep everyone safe:

1. 🔑 **Passwords** — Use a password manager. Never reuse passwords.
2. 🎣 **Phishing** — When in doubt, *don't click*. Report suspicious emails.
3. 💾 **Data handling** — No sensitive data on personal devices. Ever.
4. 🖥️ **Screen lock** — Lock your workstation when you step away.
5. 🚨 **Incidents** — See something? Report it to security *immediately*.

> ⚠️ **This is not optional.** Security is everyone's responsibility.
