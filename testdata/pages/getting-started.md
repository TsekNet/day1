# 🚀 Getting Started

Your first-day checklist — knock these out before lunch:

- ✅ **Sign in to email** — credentials were sent to your personal inbox
- 🔐 **Set up MFA** — required on *all* accounts, no exceptions
- 💬 **Join the chat** — find your team channel and say hello
- 📆 **Check your calendar** — your manager scheduled an intro 1:1

---

> 🎯 **Goal:** By end of day, you should be able to send an email,
> join a meeting, and message your team.
